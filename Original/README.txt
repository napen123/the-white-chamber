### CREDITS ###########################################################

All of the artwork in the game is by Paul Johnson

All of the sounds and music in the game are by Zakir Rahman

Most of the code is written by Richard Perrin

During the German localisation Henning Lechner fixed some bugs and
added in the voice language selector

There's also a lot of template code and graphics in there that came
with Wintermute. So that stuff isn't really ours.

### COMPILING THE GAME ################################################

the white chamber uses the wintermute engine, which is available freely
from: http://dead-code.org

You'll need to install wintermute to use this source code, but it's
all fairly straight forward. Once wintermute is installed you should be
able to open the wintermute project file and edit/compile the game
easily.

It's a fantastic and easy to use engine, just sadly Windows only so I
know that's no help for your Mac and Linux types.

### THE SOURCE CODE ####################################################

Just to be clear, I (Richard Perrin) am not a great programmer. I somehow
make a living doing it but I'm the first to admit I'm not great at it.
I'm just not really geeky enough to care about writing really nice clean
well designed code. If it works and is mostly bug free I'm happy.

On top of that I was learning wintermute as I made this game, so while
things got better as the game went along there's a lot of hacky rough
stuff in there that worked in an acceptable way so I went with it.

The point I'm making is that nothing in here should be considered "good
practice", this is all just what it took to get the game finished and
remove as many bugs as we could find.

Having said all that I'm releasing the code in the hopes that it will
still be useful to other members of the wintermute community to see how
things are done, and especially when you're starting out nothing helps
quite as much as a working example.

I originally was to going to allow derivate products in the license
because I can't say 100 different versions of the white chamber
floating around on the net appeals to me greatly. However I'm inspired
by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails releasing his albums that way and if
he's willing to embrace that ethos then so can I. So if you're going
to make a derivate please make something great and prove my fears
incorrect.

Anyway thanks to everyone who played through the game and have supported
us over the years despite our slow release patterns.

Thanks again...
